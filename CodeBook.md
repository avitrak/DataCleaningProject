DataCleaningProject
===================

Original Data Set
-----------------

The purpose of this project is to clean and present in a tidy form a data set, produced by the Human Activity Recognition project, tha was built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted Samsung Galaxy S smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. (More information on the experiment can be found here: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones))

The orignal, raw dataset contained the following variables for each record:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
