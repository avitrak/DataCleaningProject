DataCleaningProject
===================

- The raw data set is available here: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

- The contents of the above file should be unzipped and placed in the working directory for R. The result of the unzipping will be one folder, with more files inside. This folder should be renamed as "Dataset".

- After the above steps are performed, the "run_analysis.R" script can be run, producing a tidy data set. The comments in the R script will further elucidate the code. No additional packages need to be installed. Only the functions inlcuded in "base" and "stats" packages are used. Finally, the script was produced and tested in R 3.1, running on Ubuntu Linux.

- The attached "CodeBook.md" file contains the description of the data set (both raw and tidy) and the list of the variables contained in the tidy data set.
